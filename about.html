  <p>
    Modelling, analysis and machine learning is what I get the most excited about.  I love to learn better and more-optimial ways of solving problems.  I'm currently reading <i>Statistics Done Wrong</i> and working through <i>The C Programming Language</i>.  I'm currently enrolled in Metis' Data Science program in Seattle and play the violin for the Kirkland Civic Orchestra.
