    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Taner! I'm currently a Data Engineer at Amazon, working as apart of the PeopleInsight team. We work to provide actionable insights for FC Managers and HR at Amazon.  I graduated from Wabash College with a B.A. in Pure and Computational Mathematics in 2017 and have since spent my time working as a contractor at Microsoft and attending a data science bootcamp, before joining PeopleInsight in September of 2019.  For those of you that are interested in my work experience, <a href=''>here</a> is a link to my resume.  My publications will always be listed at the bottom of this page.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My interests are technologies, politics, history and video games, and if I'm not working, I'm probably playing video games, skiing, playing the violin or playing soccer.  My biggest dream is to someday create a site that shows users data on politically significant information that users may not have access to otherwise, as well as analysis on this data.</p>
